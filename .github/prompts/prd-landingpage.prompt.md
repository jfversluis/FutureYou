Based on the PRD below, let's generate a landing page for the application. With the following in mind:

- Let's use a modern style with gradient colors that are in black and yellow hues, nice fonts, and plenty of emoji, and have nice hover effects throughout brining it to live. Match the style of https://www.teamrockstars.nl/
- Make sure we have nice headers for navigation and a footer as well with standard links and copyright information. 
- The landing page should be responsive and look good on both desktop and mobile devices and work in light and dark modes with a toggle take some time reflect on the design and make it look good. make sure all of the key features are highlighted. 
- I have some Team Rockstars employee pictures in the wwwroot/images/employees that we could use. Update the existing Home.razor file.
